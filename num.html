        Num is a challenging and addictive educational iPhone game I worked on with my partner as a passion project. The main goal of this game is to create a fun and engaging way for young children to practice their mental mathematic calculation skills. Num’s objective is for players to fill in the correct math expression (left-hand side) that satisfies the solution number (right-hand side) from the given numbers and operators. With the design focus of unique but intuitive gameplays, I believe Num is a great companion for children or even adults to sharpen a skill that can be utilized in their daily lives.

      <p class= "black-80">
        My role in this project included all design-related tasks starting with brainstorming and sketching out different core gameplay designs on paper, which allowed me to ideate visually to find the best solution. I then moved on to design static mockups of the game's interface and user experience on a vector graphics application called Sketch. During this process, I created a design style as well as illustrations to evoke the game's playful and friendly characteristics. Lastly, I designed the in-game animations using motion graphics tools such as Adobe After Effects. Bringing liveliness to the game through animation is important as it helps engage players on an emotional level.

      <h2 class="black-80">Homescreen and Navigation</h2>
      <p class="black-80">
        One of the main purpose of the home screen beside providing clear direction on where to user should navigate to is provide a clear message on what the game is about. In this case, Num achieved a simple and playful design with the illustration and navigation system I've designed.

      <h2 class="black-80">Challenges</h2>
      <p class="black-80">
        Some of the challenges I faced during the design process included inconsistent design patterns for tappable elements as our play testers were confused about which elements in the game were interactive. To solve this problem I created a set of design guidelines to improve the consistency of the game, where buttons behave and look distinct from non-interactive elements.

      <h2 class="black-80">Result</h2>
      <p class="black-80">
        Num was a success as we managed to gather over 25 thousand downloads with an average of 4.5 out of 5 stars rating on the Apple App Store.
