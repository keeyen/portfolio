      <p class="black-80">
        IFTTT is an automation service and their main product helps connect different services to make them work together. They are called Applets. Together with the team, I was responsible in designing a system for IFTTT’s users to give feedback to the services they use on the platform. My role in this project includes research, brainstorm/ideation, product design, wireframing and prototyping user flows.

      <p class="black-80">
        The goal of the project is to improve the quality of Applets on the IFTTT platform. By providing ways for users to easily give useful constructive feedback to the services they are using.

      <h2 class="black-80">Brainstorming and Ideation</h2>
      <p class="black-80">
        Brainstorming helps me and my team generate different ideas and different approaches on how might we tackle the problem. We kept in mind the 3 pillars of what makes good feedback when we are brainstorming. Starting each question with “How might we…” gives us a nice starting point eventually we settled on a few approaches we would like to use to kick off the design.

      <h2 class="black-80">Wireframes</h2>
      <p class="black-80">
        Explored a wide variety of layout design, interaction flows and try to find the best way for users to rate an Applet. In the end I settled on a thumbs up/down rating metric as it the most simple and effective way to rate based on our user testing results.

      <h2 class="black-80">Final Design</h2>
      <p class="black-80">
        In the end, we settled with a design that is compact and mobile friendly with a more obvious call to action button outlook that clearly shows what the user has chosen (Thumbs up/down) and what they should do next (Submit).
